abstract: "The aliasing, off-resonance saturation, and residual signal (control-label) characteristics of pulsed continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) were measured in a 2% agar phantom using various values of label and control RF (B1) and gradient (Gmax) amplitudes. Aliasing and off-resonance saturation for both the label and control increased with increasing B1 but decreased with increasing Gmax. The residual signal also decreased with increasing Gmax."
