abstract: The present disco relates to an artificial intelligence system utilizing a machine learning algorithm, including deep learning and the like, and application thereof. 
#In particular, an electronic device of the present disclosure comprises a memory including at least one command; and a processor connected to the memory so as to control the electronic device, wherein, by executing the at least one command, the processor acquires an image, acquires a noise correction map for correction of noise of the image on the basis of configuration information of a camera having captured the image or brightness information of the image, and eliminates the noise of the image through the noise correction map. 
#In particular, at least a part of an image processing method may use an artificial intelligence model having been acquired through learning according to at least one of a machine learning algorithm, a neural network algorithm, and a deep learning algorithm. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
